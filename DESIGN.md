# Nexonauts Web — Design System

The marketing site for Nexonauts. This document captures the design language, voice,
and component patterns so every page lands consistently.

> **Stay opinionated.** Nexonauts is a tool for people who'd rather ship than fiddle.
> The site should feel the same way: confident, clean, and never overwrought.

## Binding rules

These override anything later in this file. Sections below predate them and have
drifted; where they disagree, this list wins.

**Type.** One typeface: `Geist Variable`. `Geist Mono Variable` only for code, file
names and numeric UI. No italics anywhere. Nothing heavier than semibold. Every font
size resolves to a Tailwind scale step with that step's paired line height — no
`clamp()` between steps, no `text-[19px]`, no independent line heights.

**Spacing.** Only 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96px. In Tailwind that
is `0 0.5 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 12 16 20 24`. Nothing between them. Main buttons are 8px
vertical and 12px horizontal padding.

**Backgrounds are flat.** No gradient backgrounds, no aurora, no ambient wash. The
gradient orbs still exist as components for legacy pages but are not used on the
landing page and should not be added to new work.

**The one gradient** is `.heading-gradient` on hero text: `#000000 → #666666` on
light, `#FFFFFF → #9B9B9B` on dark. Text only, never a surface.

**Dark surfaces** come from a fixed ramp: `#000000`, `#181818`, `#1F1F1F`,
`#272727`, `#313131`.

**Borders** wrap a card completely or not at all. Never one side.

**Nested radius**: when the gap between an inner and outer shape is under 32px,
`inner = outer − gap`. Apply only when the result exceeds 2px.

**Motion** always uses `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)` (`--ease-fluid`). Never a
default curve. Scroll reveals run through `IntersectionObserver` via
`revealOnView` — never a scroll listener.

**Icons** come from Phosphor (`phosphor-svelte`). Lucide remains in older chrome
and is being replaced as files are touched.

**Copy.** No hyphens inside sentences. No orphaned last-line words. Sentence case
headings. Real names and organic numbers, never `99.99%` or placeholder brands.

---

## Audience

Primary readers, in order of priority:

1. **Solo founders** — building, demoing, and pitching weekly.
2. **Indie hackers** — shipping launch videos, changelog clips, and Twitter cuts on their own schedule.
3. **Product engineers** — demoing PRs, explaining bugs, documenting APIs.

Every headline, microcopy line, and CTA should serve at least one of these readers.
If a sentence reads as if it's targeting an enterprise procurement team, rewrite it.

---

## Voice

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Direct, opinionated, founder-to-founder. | Marketing-speak ("solutions", "synergy", "leverage"). |
| Concrete verbs ("ship", "record", "trim"). | Vague abstractions ("empower", "transform"). |
| Punchy, balanced two-line headlines. | Long paragraph hero copy. |
| Emphasize *outcomes* the audience cares about (looking expensive, shipping fast). | Generic feature lists without a clear "so what?". |
| Use "Skip the editor. Ship the demo." as the through-line. | Compete on feature checklists with kitchen-sink editors. |

**Headline pattern:** *[Aspiration] that look [outcome word].*

- Demos that look **expensive.**
- Demos that look **cinematic.**
- Demos that look **intentional.**
- Demos that look **effortless.**
- Demos that look **hand-edited.**

The rotating word is always italic, lower opacity, primary-tinted, and lives on its
**own line** (see "TextLoop" below) so the headline never reflows.

---

## Color & Theme

Tokens live in [`@Nexonauts/design`](../../packages/design/src/index.css). Always use
CSS variables — never hardcode colors.

| Token | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `--background` / `--foreground` | Page background and primary text. |
| `--card` / `--card-foreground` | Surface containers (glass cards, mockups). |
| `--primary` (indigo) | The one accent. CTA, selection, focus ring, active route, toggle-on, primary chart series. |
| `--muted-foreground` | Secondary copy, microlabels. |
| `--border` / `--border-low` / `--border-strong` | Decorative separators and dividers. |
| `--border-control` | Boundaries that *identify* a control — inputs, selects, checkboxes. |
| `--destructive` / `--success` / `--warning` | Status only — never decorative. |

### Colour ratio (60/30/10)

Every surface budgets colour the same way. This is a hard rule, not a vibe:

| Share | Role | Tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **60%** | Canvas. The page ground. | `--background`, `--canvas` |
| **30%** | Structure. Surfaces, borders, secondary text, chart neutrals — everything that builds hierarchy. | `glass-card`, `bg-foreground/5-10`, `--border*`, `--muted-foreground`, `--foreground` |
| **10%** | Accent. `--primary` only. | see the reserved list below |

**`--primary` is reserved for these, and nothing else:**

1. The single main CTA on a view (default `<Button>`).
2. The sidebar active-route indicator.
3. The primary data series in a chart.
4. Selection and drag-drop targets (checkboxes, drop zones, the upload dropzone).
5. Toggle "on" states.
6. Plan / upgrade affordances (the `Crown` surfaces) — the monetization signal.
7. Focus rings and active-input borders (`--ring` is `--primary`).

**Never** use `--primary` as a decorative tint. Section-header icons, `glass-chip`
contents, avatars, play buttons, progress fills, tab underlines, and hover text
are all **neutral**. If an icon just labels a heading, it takes
`text-muted-foreground` — or no colour class at all, inheriting from its row.

There is exactly one accent hue. If a surface seems to need a second, it needs
hierarchy instead — weight, size, or spacing.

Progress and meter fills are neutral (`bg-foreground/30-60`) and escalate to
`--warning` / `--destructive` only on real thresholds, so a bar's colour always
means something. See [UsageMeter.logic.ts](src/lib/dashboard/components/UsageMeter.logic.ts).

### Contrast floors

Non-negotiable, and cheaper to check than to relitigate:

| Thing | Floor |
| --- | --- |
| Body text on its surface | 4.5:1 |
| Focus ring, control boundary, meaningful icon | 3:1 |
| Two controls distinguished by colour | 3:1 **luminance**, never hue alone |

This section exists because the old lime `--primary` measured **1.95:1** as a
focus ring in light mode. Hue-wheel distance is *not* colour-blind distance: red
and green sit far apart on the wheel and collapse under deuteranopia, so lane and
status identity must always be carried by label or shape as well as colour.

### Dark mode

`--primary` is defined per mode and holds its hue across both — `oklch(0.52 0.20
264)` on light, `oklch(0.70 0.155 264)` on dark. Test new sections in both modes.
The old lime could not do this: to stay legible on white it had to drop to L0.55,
where sRGB's gamut collapses its chroma and it reads as olive rather than lime.

---

## Typography

- **Sans / display:** `Geist Variable`. Tight tracking (`-0.02em`), `font-feature-settings: "ss01", "cv11"`.
- **Mono:** `Geist Mono Variable`. Use for code blocks, file names, stat numbers.

### Scale

Every row lands on a Tailwind scale step. Nothing is interpolated between steps.

| Use | Size |
| --- | --- |
| Hero h1 | `text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl`, `font-semibold`, `tracking-[-0.02em]`, `.heading-gradient` |
| Section h2 | `text-3xl sm:text-4xl`, `font-semibold`, `tracking-[-0.02em]` |
| Card h3 | `text-xl`, `font-semibold`, `tracking-[-0.02em]` |
| Body | `text-base`, `text-body`. Lead paragraphs `text-lg`. |
| Eyebrow | `.eyebrow` — `text-xs`, `font-semibold`, `uppercase`, `tracking-[0.08em]` |

Hero heading and subheading both cap at 680px, with manual `<br />` where the
thought breaks. `text-wrap: balance` on headings and `pretty` on body are applied
globally in `app.css`, so do not repeat them per element.

The `.display-*` utilities carry the same scale for older pages and step up at the
`sm` and `lg` breakpoints.

---

## Layout

- **Container:** `<Container>` — `max-w-6xl` default, `narrow` (3xl), `wide` (7xl), `full`.
- **Section:** `<Section spacing="default | tight | loose | none">` — `py-24 md:py-32` default.
- Pages always end with `<Footer />`.
- Section dividers: `border-t border-border-low/60`. No solid horizontal rules.

### Page rhythm

A marketing page composes top to bottom in roughly this order:

1. **Hero** — atmospheric background, eyebrow chip, two-line headline (with rotating word on its own line), one-paragraph subhead targeting the audience, primary + outline CTAs, beta line, then a glass-card preview screenshot with floating chips.
2. **Trust strip** — short uppercase eyebrow ("Built on tools makers trust") plus the tech-stack logo row (see "Trust strip" below). Honest credibility for a beta product — never fake customer logos.
3. **Triad cards** — three audience-targeted cards, each with a mini visual.
4. **Conversion section** — two columns: checklist of outcomes + a product preview screenshot with floating chips.
5. **Dual feature cards** — side-by-side mockup cards (e.g. command palette + activity bars).
6. **Big showcase** — single hero screenshot with a wash of primary glow behind it.
7. **Format / code section** — two columns: bullet list + code/config snippet styled like a tabbed editor.
8. **Intelligent features** — triptych mockup row, then a 4-cell feature row.
9. **Final CTA** — full-width glass card with eyebrow chip, hero-scale headline (with italic emphasis on second line), description, dual CTAs.
10. **Footer**.

Not every page needs every section, but ordering and visual rhythm must match.

## Components

### Glass surfaces

| Class | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `glass-card` | Feature cards, mockup containers, CTA cards. |
| `glass-chip` | Floating labels, status pills, icon containers. |
| `glass` / `glass-strong` | Navbar-style overlays. |

Glass surfaces always sit on top of an atmospheric or grid background — never
flat. Pair with `shadow-craft-md`, `shadow-craft-lg`, or `shadow-craft-xl` for
depth, plus `rounded-2xl` (cards) or `rounded-[2rem]` (CTA hero card).

### Eyebrows

```svelte
<Eyebrow icon={Sparkles} variant="primary">v0.2 beta · what's new</Eyebrow>
```

Always lead a section with an eyebrow chip when the section has a header.

### Section header

```svelte
<SectionHeader
  eyebrow="Built for modern makers"
  title="A recorder shaped to your workflow."
  description="…"
  align="left | center"
/>
```

### Buttons

- Primary CTA: `<Button size="lg" class="gap-2.5">` with a leading icon.
- Secondary CTA: `<Button variant="outline" size="lg">` with a trailing arrow.
- **Avoid** `variant="ghost"` next to a solid button — visual weight is too uneven.
- Trailing arrows use `transition-transform group-hover/cta:translate-x-0.5`.

### Reveal

Wrap any content that should fade-up on scroll in `<Reveal delay={i * 60}>`.
Stagger lists by ~60–80ms per item. Use `as="li"` when wrapping list items.

### Motion vocabulary

Nexonauts has **one motion ease**: `cubic-bezier(0.625, 0.05, 0, 1)`, exported as
`CRAFT_EASE` from `@Nexonauts/ui/utils`. It's snappy at the start and lands gently —
the same curve the FloatingMenu uses for its open/close timeline.

| Use | Duration | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hover state changes | `duration-200` | bg/text/opacity shifts on buttons, links, chips |
| Overlay enter (dropdown, popover, tooltip, hover-card, dialog) | `duration-200` | via `CRAFT_OVERLAY_ANIMATION` |
| Overlay exit | `duration-150` | slightly faster than enter — feels responsive |
| Sheet enter | `duration-300` | longer feels intentional for full-edge surfaces |
| Backdrop fade | `duration-200` enter / `150` exit | via `CRAFT_OVERLAY_BACKDROP_ANIMATION` |

**Subtlety rules:**
- Scale: `0.98` (2% delta) — never `0.95` or smaller; that reads as "popping".
- Slide: 4px (`slide-in-from-X-1`) for popovers, 24px (`slide-in-from-X-6`) for sheets.
- Avoid `ease-in-out` and `ease-linear` for state transitions — use `CRAFT_EASE`.

**For new bits-ui Content components**, import `CRAFT_OVERLAY_ANIMATION` from
`@Nexonauts/ui/utils` and prepend it to the class list. Don't hand-roll `data-open:`
animation classes per component — they will drift.

```svelte
<script>
  import { CRAFT_OVERLAY_ANIMATION, cn } from "@Nexonauts/ui/utils";
</script>

<Primitive.Content class={cn(CRAFT_OVERLAY_ANIMATION, "rounded-lg ...", className)} />
```

**Svelte transitions** (`fly`, `fade`, `slide` from `svelte/transition`) are
preferred for any in-app component you control directly. Use bits-ui's
data-state CSS animations only for portal-mounted overlays where Svelte's
`transition:` directives can't reach.

### TextLoop (rotating word)

Layout-shift safe pattern:

```svelte
<h1>
  Demos that look
  <span class="mt-2 flex justify-center font-medium italic text-foreground/40">
    <span class="inline-grid overflow-hidden">
      <TextLoop class="text-primary" texts={words} interval={3000} />
    </span>
  </span>
</h1>
```

The rotating word **must** sit on its own block-level line (a `flex` row works);
GSAP animates the inner width but the outer line is independent so the rest of
the headline never reflows.

### Trust strip

Nexonauts is in beta — **don't fabricate customer logos**. Use the open-source tech
stack as honest social proof. Logos render via [Simple Icons CDN](https://simpleicons.org)
in a muted neutral (`9ca3af`) tone so they read as a strip, not a competing focal point.

Each entry links to the project, has hover opacity transition, and shows a
text label next to the icon for readers who don't recognize the mark.

If you want to show real users in the future, switch the heading to
"Loved by teams at" and use **only** companies that have explicitly opted in.

### Section backgrounds

Superseded. Backgrounds are flat. Alternate bands between `bg-canvas` and
`bg-canvas-soft` for rhythm, and separate them with that tonal shift rather than a
rule. `bg-aurora`, `bg-ambient` and the radial washes are retired.

---

## CTA pattern

The "Skip the editor. Ship the demo." CTA is the canonical end-of-page card.
Reuse this exact structure on every page that needs a closing CTA:

- Pulsing beta chip ("v0.2 beta · ready when you are")
- Hero-scale h2 with italic emphasis on the second line
- One-line supporting copy ("Free during beta. No account required. Three platforms. One opinionated tool.")
- Solid primary CTA (`Download Nexonauts`) + outline CTA (`See what's new` / `Explore features`)
- Top-positioned radial primary glow (~22% opacity) + 1px hairline gradient on top edge

---

## Dos and Don'ts

**Do**

- Use markdown link syntax (`[file.svelte](src/lib/components/file.svelte)`) when referencing code.
- Use [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev) only.
- Reference design tokens via Tailwind utilities (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`).
- Reach for `glass-card` + `shadow-craft-*` for elevated surfaces.
- Test new sections in **both** light and dark — primary saturation differs dramatically.

**Don't**

- Hardcode hex/rgb colors. Use CSS variables and `color-mix()` in `srgb`.
- Use a different icon library mixed with Lucide.
- Stack absolute-positioned cards inside a fixed-height container — they create
  dead space and z-stack confusion with the next section. Use a grid instead.
- Use `variant="ghost"` for a secondary CTA next to a solid one — pairs badly.
- Let TextLoop animate inside an inline flow — it will shift adjacent text.

## Routes & section anchors

| Route | Sections |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | `#why`, `#record`, `#polish`, `#share`, `#founders`, `#pricing-teaser`, `#cta` |
| `/pricing` | hero, plan cards (Free / Cloud waitlist), comparison table |
| `/gamers` | hero, flow, use cases, why-vs-OBS, `#cta` |
| `/features` | pillars, supports, `#cta` |
| `/download` | hero, `#all-platforms` |
| `/changelog` | hero, release timeline |

The homepage spine is **Record → Auto-polish → Share** (see `POSITIONING.md`).
Nexonauts Cloud is not shipped — the `#share` section and `/pricing` Cloud card
sell a waitlist, never a live product.

Keep navbar/footer links in sync with these anchors. Stale anchors are silent UX bugs.
